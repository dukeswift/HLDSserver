Background : You are rats, and you live in
the Toon family's kitchen, some bad rats want
to destroy the Toon's lunch.


Counter-Terrorists: You have to stop bad rats
before they destroy the cucumber on the table
or pastes beside the pan, or Toons will try
to drive out rats of the house.

Terrorists: Destroy cucumber on the table or
pastes beside the pan, or kill all good rats.

Other Notes: There are 2 targets 
in this rats map.
