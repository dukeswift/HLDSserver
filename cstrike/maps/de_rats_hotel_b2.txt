Hotel Rats - Bomb/Defuse
Beta 2
by Cmdr

A business man gets bored at his hotel room in the evening of his business trips.
So he decides to rebuild the hotel room as a map for Counter-Strike.

Terrorists:
Rebuilding the beautiful room for such a killer game is not acceptable.
Punish this guy for his treachery by blowing up his laptop.

Counter-Terrorists:
The laptop is the property of a very important company.
Stop the evil terrorists destroying the valuable device.

Other notes:
Have fun and happy fragging!
